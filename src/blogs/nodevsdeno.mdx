## So what is Deno?

Deno is JavaScript , typescript runtime like node.js but it can run typescript natively and has so many new features related to security and module delivery.

## Why compare to node.js?

At it’s core Deno is same as node and they both uses V8 engine for javascript execution and also their creator [Ryan Dhal](https://tinyclouds.org/) is same but they are completely different how you manage your dependencies and also files.

## Why You Should Use.

### Why you should use Deno?

Deno has future because of it’s growing community and also it has so many features that node is lacking and also it is so much secure and better run time than node.

### Why you should use node?

Although Deno is future proof but node has so much bigger community than any other platform and also if you find yourself stuck you can easily find solution.

## Things that are changed with Deno.

- Have to give [permission](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/permission_apis) for accessing files read and write , net , hrtime , etc.
- [Importing modules](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code) is completely change and now you can import from url and file sitting on CDN
- No-Package Manager / No-Modules Folder. All the modules fetch from URL cache under Deno and you don’t need to worry about that
- Don’t worry about different setup for typescript it’s just works out of the box.
- Deno has different built in APIs than node because all of async calls end up in some sort of promise.

## Conclusion

Deno is the future, but node is current the king for JavaScript development thanks to massive size of community and millions of open source package.
